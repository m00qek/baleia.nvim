[1mTHE LEGEND OF THE TECHNICOLOR TERM[0m

Once upon a time, in a [3mvery quiet[23m directory, lived a [31mlittle[0m [32mgreen[0m [34mcursor[0m.

It dreamed of [1;4mbold new worlds[0m where [38;5;208moranges[0m and [38;5;135mpurples[0m danced together.
"Why be [2mdim[22m," it asked, "when one can be [1;3;35mfabulously magenta[0m?"

One day, the cursor found a magical [4:3mcurly underline[4:0m. It was [58;5;196mred and wavy[59m!
Then it found a [4:2mdouble underline[4:0m that was [58;2;0;255;255mcyan and true[59m.

"Look at me!" it shouted in [38;2;255;100;100mT[38;2;100;255;100mr[38;2;100;100;255mu[38;2;255;255;100me[38;2;100;255;255mC[38;2;255;100;255mo[38;2;255;255;255ml[38;2;100;100;100mo[38;2;0;0;0mr[0m!

Suddenly, a [7mREVERSE VILLAIN[27m appeared! "I will [9mstrike you through[29m!"
But the cursor was too fast. It dodged [31mleft[39m and [32mright[39m.
It combined its powers: [1;31;4;58;5;226mBold Red with Yellow Underline![0m

The villain gasped: "[38;5;52mSuch... [38;5;88mpower...[0m"
And thus, the terminal was saved.
