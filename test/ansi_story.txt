The [1mChronicles[22m of the [3mRainbow[23m Terminal

Once upon a time, in a land of [4mmonochrome[24m screens, a hero emerged.
They wielded the power of [31mRed[39m, [32mGreen[39m, and [34mBlue[39m to bring life to the void.

Their journey began in the [90mdark forest[39m, where shadows whispered in [30;47mblack on white[39;49m.
Suddenly, a [1;33mbright yellow sun[0m burst forth!

"Behold!" cried the hero, utilizing the ancient [38;5;208mOrange (256-color)[39m magic.
"I can even summon [38;2;255;105;180mTrueColor Hot Pink[39m dragons!"

The dragon roared, its breath a mix of [3mitalicized flames[23m and [9mstruck-through smoke[29m.
It flew over [42moceans of green background[49m and [104mbright blue skies[49m.

But wait, there's more! The [4:3mcurly underline[24m of the Kitty clan appeared.
Followed by the [4:2mdouble underline[24m of the elite guard.
And the [4:4mdotted path[24m leading to the [4:5mdashed hidden treasure[24m.

Even the [7mREVERSE[27m world could not withstand their color.
And so, the terminal was forever changed, living happily in [1;31;43mBold Red on Yellow[0m.

[38;5;51mThe[0m [38;5;50mEnd[0m.
